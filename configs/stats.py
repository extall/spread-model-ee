# 1. We assume that each person takes the test only once.
# 2. We discard any test that references an unknown county.
# 3. We assume that only individuals with symptoms take the test. This means we only count "infected" persons that will
#    be converted to proper person class later in the simulation.
# 4. We draw statistics for "time to recovery" and apply them to each individual tested positive
#    so that we can get a more or less accurate starting point for the simulation where we set up the initial amount
#    of infected per area ID=1...8 (see above). Thus, if a person recovers before the simulation is started, we do not
#    consider them in the simulation (maybe count towards recovered?)
# 5. We consider the worst case scenario by drawing from "symptoms to recovery" distribution since we do not take into
